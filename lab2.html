                    I wake up at 6 am, eat breakfast, shower and get ready to commute to Humber. During my commute,
                    I read my book,<q>Atomic Habits</q>, and the news and reach college around <time>8:30Pm</time> I
                    drink my coffee from Starbucks and
                    attend classes till <time>3 Pm</time> after which I head home. <br> I often eat my lunch in the bus
                    while
                    travelling back and rest for until 6pm. Then I get fresh and start studying a little until its
                    my time to gym at <time>7:30Pm</time>.<br> Afterwards, I shower and get dinner till around
                    <time>10Pm</time> and get into
                    bed. Now, depending on my work, I either work and study at night or watch a movie and sleep by
